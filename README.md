# Panoramic-Image-Stitching-SIFT
<p align="justify">
This repository contains the C++ implementation of Panoramic Image Stitching using Scale Invariant Feature Transform.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Principle of homography is used in order to stitch two images. Images considered have at least 40% overlap.
<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf" target="_blank">Scale Invariant Feature Transform</a> descriptor is modified to generate <code>Homography Matrix</code> which is used to stitch the two images.
